# Market Trend Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project applies deep learning (LSTM and Transformer) to forecast financial market trends using the Kaggle Market Trend Analysis dataset. Baseline models (Prophet, SARIMA) are included for comparison. Interpretability is achieved with SHAP and attention visualization.

## Folder Structure
- `project_outputs/`: Directory for saving results.
- `project_outputs/metrics.json`: Performance metrics for all models.
- `project_outputs/report.md`: Detailed report on models, metrics, and interpretability.
- `project_outputs/lstm_predictions.png`: Plot of LSTM predictions vs. true values.
- `project_outputs/shap_feature_importance.png`: Bar plot of SHAP feature importance for LSTM.

## How to Run
1. Upload `market_trend.csv` to Google Drive.
2. Mount Drive in Colab and set `CSV_PATH`.
3. Run the notebook cells step by step.
4. Outputs (metrics, reports, plots) will be saved in `project_outputs`.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow 2.15
- scikit-learn
- Prophet
- statsmodels
- shap
- matplotlib, seaborn

## Results
- LSTM and Transformer outperform baselines on RMSE, MAE, MAPE.
- SHAP and attention provide insights into feature importance and temporal dependencies.
